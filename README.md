# Volume Rendering (VTK)

- The main idea of the project was to understand how VTK.js work and how to use it.
- First of all we installed node.js
- Then we started running some examples from the VTK.js website and here are some screenshots:

#### 1. PiecewiseGaussianWidget:

## Issues we faced:
1. it was hard to understand VTK and modify the examples to match the requirements of the project.
2. it was hard to understand HTML , Css and js for the first time, which took us most of the time.
3. Sometimes when running the code there are no errors shown but the website doesn't work so we had to trace all the code back multible times.
4. we tried to load the head and chest data one single time to make the website faster, but we couldn't.
5. when we switch between head and chest, some parts of the volume doesn't show properly but when we adjust the cutting widget, every thing works fine.



## Final thoughts:
- the project had a lot of advantages to us as students as well as engineers like time mangaments, self learning , html+css+js+vtk+react concepts ..etc

- when we settle down and look back to our journey with this task, we supposed that it would be much easier . but we found that it is a real challenge .but  we managed to make some progress, week by week  and day after day . And it was amazing feeling that we achieved good results eventually.
